# Firebird

I'm tired of blue-centric Vim themes. What's wrong with a warm color palette
anyway?

Firebird is a very simple theme based on
[Libertine](https://github.com/rdavison/Libertine). I'm very actively
developing this theme. I **do not** recommend using it now. Please wait until
it looks half way decent.
